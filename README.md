## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure the bot:**
    *   Open `main.py`.
    *   At the very bottom of the file, find the line `bot.run('token')` and replace `'token'` with your actual Discord bot token.
    *   (Optional) Customize the `log_channel_id` and `log_server_id` variables for command logging.
    *   (Optional) Customize the status message in the `change_status` task.

4.  **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Commands

Here is a list of the main commands available:

### General Commands

*   `/ping`: Displays the bot's current latency.
*   `!create_invite`: Creates a permanent invite to the server. (Requires 'Manage Server' permission).

### Fun & Utility

*   `/counter [salon]`: Sets up a counting channel. Users must count in sequential order without posting twice in a row. (Requires Administrator permission).
*   `/button`: Displays a message with various interactive buttons.
*   `/selecteur`: Displays a message with an interactive select menu.
*   `/testbutton`: Displays a message with a persistent button that works even after the bot restarts.

*   `!start [secondes]`: Changes the interval for the bot's status rotation. (Bot owner only).

## Cogs

The bot's functionality is organized into cogs (extensions), which can be found in the `cog/` directory.

*   `mp.py`: Handles the private messaging command.
*   `counter.py`: Manages the counting channel feature.
*   `button.py`, `selecteur.py`, `Layout_exemple.py`, `persistant.py`: Contain examples of various UI components.
*   `test_counter.py`: An alternative implementation of the counting game using local files.
*   `exemple_cog.py`, `tests.py`: Simple example cogs.

**Note:** The original `cog/s√©lecteur.py` file remains in the repository due to a tool limitation that prevented its deletion. The bot now uses `cog/selecteur.py` instead.
